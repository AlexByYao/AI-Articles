## Summary / 摘要

This article explores why the same Claude model has different pricing across various providers and resellers.

本文探讨了同一个 Claude 模型在不同渠道价格差异的原因。

## Key Points / 要点

### 1. Official Channels / 官方渠道

- **Anthropic API**: Direct access, transparent per-token pricing
- **Amazon Bedrock (AWS)**: Enterprise-grade, may offer volume discounts
- **Google Cloud Vertex AI**: Integrated with GCP ecosystem

### 2. Third-party Resellers / 第三方转售

Third-party providers may offer lower prices through:
- API key pooling / API Key 池化共享
- Regional price arbitrage / 区域差价套利
- Rate-limited or throttled services / 限速降级服务

### 3. Reverse-engineered Channels / 逆向渠道

Some providers use unofficial methods to access Claude:
- Web session hijacking
- Violates Terms of Service
- Unstable and unreliable

## Comparison Table / 对比表

| Channel Type | Price Level | Stability | Compliance |
|-------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Official API | Standard | High | Compliant |
| Cloud Platforms | Near official | High | Compliant |
| Licensed Resellers | Slightly higher | Medium-High | Generally compliant |
| Discount Resellers | Below official | Unstable | Risky |
| Reverse Channels | Very low | Very unstable | Non-compliant |

## Takeaway / 总结

When choosing an API provider, consider not just the price but also stability, compliance, and data privacy. The cheapest option often comes with hidden costs.

选择 API 渠道时，不应只看价格，还需要考虑稳定性、合规性和数据隐私。最便宜的选择往往伴随隐性成本。
